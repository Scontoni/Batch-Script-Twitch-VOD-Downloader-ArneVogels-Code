# Batch Script for [ArneVogel's](https://github.com/ArneVogel/concat) Twitch VOD Download CMD Program

A simple script I wrote in about 30 minutes from StackExchange searches.

It takes user input for the VoD ID, desired file name and start and end times and runs [ArneVogel's](https://github.com/ArneVogel/concat) CMD program to download the VoD from Twitch.

It has some (very little) error prevention (comments explaining in code).


Usage:
Download the [.bat file](Concat_Easy_Script.bat) to the same location as ArneVogel's concat_win.exe
Double click on the .bat file and follow given instructions.
