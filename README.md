# Batch Script for ArneVogel's Twitch VOD Download CMD Program

A simple script I wrote in about 30 minutes from StackExchange searches.

It takes user input for the VoD ID, desired file name and start and end times and runs ArneVogel's CMD program to download the VoD from Twitch.

It has some (very little) error prevention (comments explaining in code).


Usage:
Download the .bat file to the same location as ArneVogel's concat_win.exe
Double click on the .bat file and follow given instructions.
